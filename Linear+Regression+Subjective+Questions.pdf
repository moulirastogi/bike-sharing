Assignment-based Subjective Questions and Answers
1. From your analysis of the categorical variables from the dataset, what could you infer about their
effect on the dependent variable? (3 marks)
Ans:
● There is an increase in the bike rental count in spring and summer seasons , and then a decrease in
the bike rental count in fall and winter season.
● The demand for rental bikes increased in the year 2019 when compared with the year 2018.
● Month Jun to Sep is the period when bike demand is high. The Month Jan is the lowest demand
month.
● Bike demand is less in holidays in comparison to when not being holidays.
● The demand for rental bikes is almost similar throughout the weekdays.
● There is no significant change in bike demand with working days and non working days.
● During clear, partly cloudy weather, the bike rental count is the highest, second-highest during misty
cloudy weather, and followed by 3rd highest, during light snow and light rain weather.

2. Why is it important to use drop_first=True during dummy variable creation? (2 mark)
Ans:
drop_first=True is important to use, as it helps in reducing the extra column created during
dummy variable creation. Hence it reduces the correlations created among dummy variables.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Looking at the pair-plot among the numerical variables, which one has the highest correlation with
the target variable? (1 mark)
Ans:
● The temp and atemp variables are highly positively correlated to each other, it means that both are
carrying the same information.
● The total_count,casual and registered are highly positively correlated to each other.

4. How did you validate the assumptions of Linear Regression after building the model on the training
set? (3 marks)
Ans: We used R-squared , or Coefficient of Determination , which is 0.81 on average in our case . It means
that the predictor is only able to predict 81% of the variance in the target variable which is contributed by
independent variables.

5. Based on the final model, which are the top 3 features contributing significantly towards explaining
the demand of the shared bikes? (2 marks)
Ans:
● Temperature
● weathersit
● Year

General Subjective Questions and Answers
1. Explain the linear regression algorithm in detail. (4 marks)
Ans: Linear regression is one of the very basic forms of machine learning where we train a model to predict the
behavior of your data based on some variables. In the case of linear regression , as you can see the name suggests
linear, that means the two variables which are on the x-axis and y-axis should be linearly correlated.
Mathematically, we can write a linear regression equation as:
Where a and b given by the formulas:
Here, x and y are two variables on the regression line.
b = Slope of the line
a = y-intercept of the line
x = Independent variable from dataset
y = Dependent variable from dataset

2. Explain the Anscombe’s quartet in detail. (3 marks)
Ans: Anscombe’s Quartet can be defined as a group of four data sets which are nearly identical in simple
descriptive statistics, but there are some peculiarities in the dataset that fool the regression model if
built. They have very different distributions and appear differently when plotted on scatter plots.
It was constructed in 1973 by statistician Francis Anscombe to illustrate the importance of plotting the
graphs before analyzing and model building, and the effect of other observations on statistical
properties. There are these four data set plots which have nearly the same statistical observations, which
provide the same statistical information that involves variance, and mean of all x,y points in all four
datasets.

3. What is Pearson’s R? (3 marks)
Ans: In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient ― also known as Pearson's R, the Pearson
product-moment correlation coefficient, the bivariate correlation, or colloquially simply as the
correlation coefficient ― is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data.
Formula:

4. What is scaling? Why is scaling performed? What is the difference between normalized scaling
and standardized scaling? (3 marks)
Ans:
● Scaling is a step of data Pre-Processing which is applied to independent variables to normalize
the data within a particular range. It also helps in speeding up the calculations in an
algorithm.
● Most of the times, the collected data set contains features highly varying in magnitudes, units
and range. If scaling is not done then the algorithm only takes magnitude in account and not
units hence incorrect modeling. To solve this issue, we have to do scaling to bring all the
variables to the same level of magnitude. Scaling just affects the coefficients and none of the
other parameters like t-statistic, F-statistic, p-values, R-squared, etc.
● Normalized / Min-Max scaling vs Standardized scaling:
Normalized: It brings all of the data in the range of 0 and 1.
sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler helps to implement normalization in python.
Standardization replaces the values by their Z scores. It brings all of the data into a standard
normal distribution which has mean (μ) zero and standard deviation one (σ).
sklearn.preprocessing.scale helps to implement standardization in Python.

5. You might have observed that sometimes the value of VIF is infinite. Why does this happen? (3
marks)
Ans: If there is perfect correlation, then VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) = infinity. This shows a perfect
correlation between two independent variables. In the case of perfect correlation, we get R2 =1,
which leads to 1/(1-R2) = infinity. To solve this problem , we need to drop one of the variables from
the dataset which is causing this perfect multicollinearity.
An infinite VIF value indicates that the corresponding variable may be expressed exactly by a linear
combination of other variables (which show an infinite VIF as well).

6. What is a Q-Q plot? Explain the use and importance of a Q-Q plot in linear regression. (3 marks)
Ans:
● Q-Q Plots (Quantile-Quantile plots) are plots of two quantiles against each other. A quantile is
a fraction where certain values fall below that quantile. For example, the median is a quantile
where 50% of the data fall below that point and 50% lie above it.
● The purpose of Q Q plots is to find out if two sets of data come from the same distribution.
● A 45 degree angle is plotted on the Q Q plot; if the two data sets come from a common
distribution, the points will fall on that reference line.
